    michelle "Once. Well, three times now, but once before this week. It was a long time ago."

    doug "But what is it?"

    "Depression washes over me as waves of memories with Max tumble across my mind."

    "Memories that have been erased from everyone's history."

    "Everyone's - except mine."

    "I suddenly feel alone; tormented and alone. How can a great person such as Max suddenly cease to exist?"

    "Until now I wasn't ready to accept it, but seeing this dirty, matter-of-fact girl explain things somehow makes me realise that this is for real."

    "Max is gone. {w}Dead."

    "Worse than dead. {w}Erased."

    "And I can never talk to anyone about it."

    show michelle jacket profile lookaway closer

    michelle "I didn't. But it's five years this summer."

    "Five years. She would have been about 10."

    doug "And you've never told anyone?"

    michelle "Yes and no. When I told people they thought that I was crazy."

    michelle "And I didn't know if I dreamed it or not. So I kept my mouth shut."

    doug "…and went patrolling every night?"

    show michelle jacket front closer

    "Michelle nods, silently."

    "Five years… five years thinking that she was crazy."

    "Five years of sneaking out at night to go and patrol."

    "Five years of keeping your mouth shut about something you desperately needed to talk about."

    "Dealing with a death of someone close is painful, like a dagger in the heart."

    "Even I want to curl up and cry for Max, but I know that I can't."

    "But Michelle never even got that chance."

    "I recall the sheer terror that flowed through me when I saw the serpent. How on earth would a 10-year-old react to that?"
