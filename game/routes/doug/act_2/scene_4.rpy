    "The ride back to my house is painfully lonely, made worse by the realisation that I can't publicly mourn my friend."

    "Ever."

    "What Michelle told me appears to be true. No-one I know has heard of Max before."

    "If a 'real' person had died, everyone would gather around me and support me."

    "I'd seen it before; when I was in year seven a senior was killed in a car crash."

    "The school practically turned into a therapy centre for about a month."

    "I didn't understand why at the time, but I do now."

    "And yet, if I bring anything up, I'm going to be sent to therapy. Not to grieve, but to cure my 'insanity'."

    "I sniff back tears as the wind streaks past my face. I hope that my eyes don't give me away when I get home."

    "Thankfully, it appears as the house is silent, so I manage to make it to my room without raising suspicion."

    "Tales of rainbow serpents mean nothing to me right now."

    "I replay memories in my mind, trying to place Max's face front and centre."

    "The trees we used to climb."

    "Jumping off rocks and into the river."

    "Riding our bikes out to see the quarry outside of town."

    "But the harder I try to focus on his face, the harder it gets to remember his features."

    "I pull out my phone and try to find photos of him, but it's no good."

    "Just as Michelle said, he's been erased from history."

    "I know that I took photos of us last week, but now some stranger looks back at me from the screen."

    "A new timeline. New friends."

    "My room is now practically dark, allowing my mind to generate its own images."

    "I try to force Max's face to the fore, but it's a futile effort."

    "All I see is the shifting rainbow of the serpent's skin."

    "Its multiple, blinking eyes."

    "The rows of teeth framing its red, bottomless maw."

    "I shudder. Adrenaline kept me from noticing too many details, but now as my mind recreates the scene I have no choice."

    "My grief begins to be replaced with terror as the image swirls around my darkened room."

    "And that sound, like a contained tsunami combined with a thunderstorm; an eternal torrent of noise."

    "I choke up a little as I realise that this would have been the last thing that Max saw in this universe."

    "He must have been terrified - alone and terrified."

    "I squeeze my eyes shut and curl up into a ball on my bed. I can feel tears well up behind my eyelids but I pay them no heed."

    "All I want right now is to hold someone - anyone - and to have them tell me that everything will be alright."

    "That this is a bad dream, and that this 'Michelle' was conspiring to make me feel bad."

    "But, deep down, I know the truth of my new reality."

    "Max is dead, and I couldn't even lay a finger on the beast that killed him."

    "I couldn't even warn him to run."

    "I feel powerless.{w} Useless.{w} Scared."

    "Now I understand Michelle's passion. At ten years old, alone, she wouldn't have had the benefit of self control that I have."

    "She must have been driven crazy by not knowing what was real and what was implanted by the serpent."

    "At least I have that advantage."

    "Michelle."

    "She said something about someone else… Weeum?"

    "It doesn't sound like any name I've heard before."

    "In any case, Michelle is the only person for now that can understand what I'm going through."

    "Not that it makes sleeping any easier."

    "I take some deep breaths and somehow manage to get my silent sobbing under control."

    "Get it together. Getting depressed isn't going to help anyone."

    "That beast is out there, and it's going to keep doing this to other people until we find a way to put a stop to it."

    "So that's what we'll have to do. Tomorrow I'll find Michelle and extract every bit of information from her that I can."
