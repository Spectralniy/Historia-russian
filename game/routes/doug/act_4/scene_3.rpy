    "Confirming all this makes the pain of the loss sharper but I can't help but welcome it. It's better than the confusion I've felt for the last couple of days."

    doug "Look, I can explain… just not now… ok?"

    natalia "No… It's not ok."

    natalia "You… you have a chance to do something with yourself."

    "I'm conflicted. Part of me wants to defend Michelle, but I can't do that without making Natalia think that I'm crazy."

    "And what excuse do I have for sneaking out at night to see a girl if we're not dating?"

    "Natalia has put me on the spot and I have nowhere to go."

    "Natalia nods and sits down on my bed, the sprung frame creaking at the weight of two people."

    natalia "She's always kept to herself. No-one knows why."

    natalia "Even in group work she does the bare minimum to not get in trouble, but that's it."

    natalia "She's absent all the time. Just doesn't show up after lunch, or comes in late."

    natalia "Sometimes you can tell that she hasn't showered."

    natalia "When she has to do a presentation it's always on some weird shit. One time she lectured us on Aboriginal culture for a science presentation."

    natalia "Like you read about with serial killers."

    "I resist the urge to laugh. Natalia is clearly taking this seriously, but at the same time she's going over the top."

    "What if I'm wrong about Michelle? Natalia has known her longer than I have."

    "She just appeared in my world a few days ago; Natalia would have been dealing with her for years."

    "And I still have no idea exactly what I have stashed in our garden shed."

    "But I know for sure that it is related to her obsession with petrochemicals."

    "Doubt begins to creep into my mind. What if her contact with the Serpent has turned her into a psychopath?"

    "Or is that the fate of everyone that stares into the infinity within that beast?"

    "I shudder at the thought."

    "And then I remember her awkward smile and pat on the back when she was talking about Max."

    "The self-mockery when she admitted to everyone thinking of her as a weirdo."

    "She wasn't twisted, she was just a regular girl, tormented by a past she could not explain to anyone."

    "If she wasn't there for me, if she hadn't explained to me all those things about the serpent, I'd probably just go mad myself."

    "But Nat would never understand that. And no matter what I say, she's known Michelle far longer. There's no way I could convince her."

    "I can only try to put her mind at ease."

    doug "I don't think it's that bad…"

    show natalia sad closer

    natalia "That's what everyone says about those murderers. 'He was such a normal guy, we never suspected anything…'"

    doug "Well, that might be true. But it's not like we're dating."

    doug "We're working on something together, but I can't tell you about it."

    "My mind races to find an excuse, but nothing but flimsy half-truths come to mind."

    "Something floats to the surface. It's half-arsed, but it will have to do."

    doug "It's the Duke of Edinburgh's Award."

    show natalia upset closer

    natalia "The what now?"

    doug "The Duke of Ed Award. Remember? They did a presentation at school earlier in the year."

    doug "You do a bunch of things and you get a certificate. It helps you get into some universities."

    doug "It's like scouts but without the uniforms and salutes."

    show natalia question closer
    with Dissolve(0.2)

    "I'm glad I remembered that much. I only attended the presentation because Max thought it would be a good way to skip an English lesson."

    "We goofed around at the back of the hall until it was over, grabbed our bags, and left without signing up."

    doug "You need to do a volunteer thing, so Michelle is helping me with a meals on wheels thing…"

    "I trail off, watching Natalia's face for a reaction. Deadpan eyes look back at me."

    "I can see her processing the thought."

    "Finally, she answers."

    natalia "So you're doing this to get into uni? Feeding the homeless?"

    natalia "With a psychopath who barely says a word to another person in school?"

    doug "I saw her there and asked how I could help out."

    "Silence again fills my storage room-cum-bedroom. I can see Natalia pouring over my lie, looking for a crack in the armour."

    natalia "…I don't know how I could go on."

    "I can see that she is holding back tears. I can sort of see where she is coming from."

    "I'm sure that she's getting the 'suicide watch' lectures in her health classes, and that is probably playing on her mind."

    "Not that we know anyone that has committed suicide, but then again, there's a first time for everything."

    doug "You don't have to worry about me."

    doug "I'm doing all of this so that I can get out of this backwater town. I want to go to a big uni somewhere and do something with myself."

    doug "So I need every boost that I can get."

    "It's better to wrap a lie in some truth. I want out of this place, but at the same time, I haven't really done much towards that end."

    "And now I'm fighting some phantom lizard with a psychopath."

    "That doesn't seem like a wise career path to me."

    "But it's something that needs to be done. And maybe a psychopath is what I need to help me do that."

    natalia "Ok. Just… get away from Michelle as soon as you can."

    natalia "Get this Duke of whatever thing out of your system, then get away from her before she gets attached."

    "As she disappears into the hallway, I ponder her concern."

    "Sure, I haven't been myself, but she's normally never said anything bad about anyone before."

    "It's… unnerving. So far I've blindly followed Michelle's directions. Maybe she has been wrong about this the whole time?"

    "Maybe she is leading me astray somehow? Or that there is some ulterior motive to her actions?"

    "I don't know. Maybe I'll talk to her a bit on tomorrow's patrol."

    "Natalia doesn't know the whole story. How could she? And without that, of course someone like Michelle would look like a psychopath."

    "But then again, killing snakes sounds like something that she would do."
