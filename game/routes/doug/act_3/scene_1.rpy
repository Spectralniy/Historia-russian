    "Thank heavens for that."

    "The crowd of my classmates seems somewhat odd to me. Their faces are familiar, and they all seem happy to talk to me…"

    "…but somehow I'm simply not interested in them."

    "I join them in the quadrangle as we eat our lunch, but I can't get into their conversations."

    "Playful banter simply doesn't excite me anymore. I can't get their jokes."

    "Thankfully, my cloudy attitude leads them to partially ignore me. They acknowledge that I'm there but don't try to drag me into the conversation."

    "I swallow my tasteless sandwich in peace."

    michelle "Psst!"

    "As much as I don't want to be with my friends, I didn't really want to deal with that voice today, either."

    "She's not going to go away."

    "I turn to a classroom window which has been cracked open, and see a finger beckoning me towards it."

    "Shoving the remainder of my sandwich in my mouth, I head towards the window."

    "Surprisingly, her uniform is clean, and her hair less tangled than it was last night."

    "Does she start every day looking like a normal student and then get progressively grubbier during her 'patrols'?"

    "At this point, it doesn't bother me."

    doug "That's not what I meant. Only… you know. People talk."

    "It's a small town here. Nothing much happens, meaning that every little action can become a rumour that spreads like wildfire."

    michelle "And it's better than trying to wrestle it."

    doug "Wait… bring him food?"

    michelle "Yeah, bread, fruit, that kind of thing."

    doug "I don't mean 'tell me what food means…' - I mean why would you need to bring him food?"

    michelle "Oh - he's homeless. I'm not sure where he gets his food from but he always seems hungry."

    "I resist the urge to roll my eyes. Of course the grotty, weird girl has a homeless friend."

    "Maybe he was the only one she could talk to without calling her crazy."

    "Like, things might be bad with her but she could at least be superior to one person."

    michelle "When I told him about the attack on my aunt and uncle, he said it reminded him of the stories he heard as a child."

    doug "So that's why you call it the Rainbow Serpent?"

    michelle "That's what he said. He knows it from some old legend."

    "Michelle seems genuinely happy to tell this story. It's almost as if having someone hear her out is enough to cheer her up."

    "And maybe this Weeum guy was the only guy to listen to her for the last five years."

    "Even if he was just some bum who wanted attention."

    "Ew."

    "The thought of a young girl hanging out with a homeless old man conjures thoughts too horrid to explain to my mind."

    michelle "He's usually on the edge of town though so we don't see each other often."

    michelle "He doesn't like coming into the city, even if he could find food and somewhere to sleep."

    michelle "I've tried to get him to stay at the shelter sometimes but he refuses."
