    "I still feel a little violated, like there has been an interloper snooping about my mind."

    doug "What do you mean?"

    michelle "He {i}told{/i} me that one day I would win."

    michelle "Defeat that monster."

    michelle "And now he says it can’t be killed?"

    doug "Well, he didn’t say that. He said a Dirawong could…"

    michelle "Dirawong my arse. That thing is alive, so it can be killed."

    michelle "Thank you."

    michelle "Well, of course."

    michelle "Can you think of any other reason to go and see the guy?"

    michelle "He's always drunk, or asleep, or both. But when he puts on his Eyes, none of that seems to matter."

    michelle "But, there's a catch. When he puts on the Eyes he wants to read someone... And that's not going to be me."

    doug "Eyes? I think I saw that. Some kind of golden shine?"

    michelle "Yeah. Those Eyes. When he's got those Eyes on, he's a different person."

    "Michelle turns from me in a huff, grabbing me by the hand and leading me down the back streets of the town."

    "Part of me is embarrassed to be led around by this diminutive girl, but something also feels right about it."

    "After the assault from Weeum, it feels nice to be touching another person."

    "It's a strange sensation to have to explain."

    "But the fact that she isn't reading my mind right now is comforting."

    "At least she has enough sense to not discuss arson in public."

    "I thank her, and to my relief, she departs the table quickly."

    doug "After you left, Weeum told me something else."

    doug "He said he doesn't know why the serpent is back, but he seemed to imply that it had a reason."

    doug "Maybe if we can find out why it is here, of all places, then maybe we can stop it that way?"

    michelle "We don't even know where it will attack. How do you think we can work out what it wants?"

    doug "Shouldn't we try to find some kind of similarities between those attacks?"

    michelle "You really are a genius, aren't you?"

    doug "What do you mean?"

    michelle "Apart from your friend and my uncle and aunt, we don't even know who's been killed."

    michelle "And even if we did know that, there's no record of them left.{w} Anywhere."

    michelle "Now I understand why you need to study so much."

    "Getting dressed down by Michelle hits home. Of course we know nothing about the victims."

    "Maybe that is part of the point."

    doug "You're right."

    "I search through Weeum's words to try to find any shred of an answer."

    doug "Weeum said that we might not be able to kill it, but we can fight it."

    doug "I think that is the only real choice that we have, right?"

    doug "If we are fast enough, then maybe we can at least chase it off before it kills anyone?"

    michelle "Oh, no, I'm going to kill it. That is for sure."

    michelle "There's no other option. Some way or another, I'm going to kill it."

    "She truly is a mad woman, but somehow, I can respect her for that."

    "At any point she could have given up and hidden this monster from her world."

    "Gone about her life in any way she wanted to."

    "But she is facing it head-on, regardless of the odds."

    "And it's clear to me that she won't stop fighting until the serpent… or herself… is gone from this world."

    "A real battle to the death."

    michelle "Says that his people never came down the the riverside in these parts."

    doug "That's a shame. He seems like he could be a help."

    michelle "I suppose. But we fight with what we've got."

    michelle "We know it doesn't like turps. Maybe I need to set it on fire next time."

    doug "What, you mean you're going to run around with a molotov cocktail and hope we find it?"

    "And with a flash, Michelle is gone, leaving me with the tab for her coffee."

    "I guess it's not the worst thing that could happen."

    "I resist the urge to go back to Weeum. I want to quiz him on as many things as I can, but the lingering sensation in my mind dissuades me."

    "Maybe he really is just a mad man living in the woods."

    "Maybe I imagined him reading my mind."

    "Michelle could have easily told him what to say. The light in his eyes could have been the sun's reflection."

    "I don't know what to think anymore. When I was with Weeum I thought that my memories were clearer."

    "But now, back in the real world, I'm not so sure."

    "It's like that tree-cave in the bush was like a bubble around a different world."

    "A similar feeling to the bubble around the house last night."

    "In any case, I'm committed to going out tonight. If I don't, Michelle will beat down my door to get to me."

    "I can't have that. Dad is on my case enough as is. If he thinks that I'm wasting time on a girl… one in Natalia's grade no less… he'll flip."

    "Then again, I don't want to be dragged into an unwinnable battle."

    "Maybe if we can find out what the serpent is looking for then we can give it what it wants."

    "Is there a way to bargain with a mythical being?"

    "Might be better than throwing our lives away fighting ghosts every night."

    "There is no way I'll be able to pass my finals if I'm not at home."

    "But stopping this snake seems more important than that right now."

    "I try and drive thoughts of exams and school from my mind."

    "This overgrown worm is a threat to the town."

    "Who knows who could be next?"

    "What if it took Natalia?"

    "Or Michelle…?"

    "Somehow I don't think that I could forgive myself if it attacked either of them."

    "Newfound resolve charges me from the inside out."

    "Weeum could be wrong. If we try hard enough, we could find out a way to kill it, or at least chase it off."

    "It only means that Michelle and I need to put our heads together and see what works."

    "Maybe tonight I'll speak to her about what she's tried so far."

    "Part of me starts to get excited. I almost want it to attack again, so that we can learn more about it."

    "And, somehow, kill it."
