    "The houses here are definitely of a lower quality than in the city centre."

    "They're made of the old asbestos-laced Weather Board that was popular in the 70's but totally illegal now."

    "It's a wonder that they still exist."

    "Out of sight, out of mind."

    "The lawns are overgrown and dried; tufts of pale yellow grass jut out from old brickwork at odd angles."

    "There's even a car propped up on a cinder block in one front yard."

    "But not a person in sight. It's hard to tell if no-one lives here at all, or if they are simply used to hiding from the rest of the world."

    "A blue plastic tarpaulin is stretched between four trees to increase the protection from the rain."

    "Beneath it, a aged sleeping bag sits atop what looks like a yoga mat, surrounded by candy-striped plastic shopping bags bulging with odd shapes."
